    <h3>Live salmon being held by a fisherman</h3>
    <p>While it may sound complicated for many, pan-searing a salmon can be done in no time.</p>
    <p>The only think you should pay attention to is when to flip the salmon so it doesn't get over nor undercooked.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Salmon 2 fillets</li>
        <li>Olive oil 1 tablespoon</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Put the olive oil in a pan and heat it up</li>
        <li>Lay the salmon fillets on the pan</li>
        <li>As you notice the fillet gets cooked just about halfway its height, flip it</li>
        <li>Pay close attention to the fillets as they cook. Right after the heat gets its other half cooked, turn off the heat and serve it</li>
    </ol>
